## 🚀 **Try It Yourself!**

### **1️⃣ Running Locally (Easiest Way)**

```bash
# Clone my project
git clone https://github.com/P-Saroha/Sentiment-Analysis-EndToEnd-MLOPS.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-EndToEnd-MLOPS

# Set up virtual environment (I use myenv)
python -m venv myenv
.\myenv\Scripts\activate   # Windows (I'm on Windows!)

# Install everything you need
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the complete pipeline (takes a few minutes)
python run_complete_pipeline.py

# Start the Flask app
cd flask_app
python app.py
```

### **2️⃣ Docker Version (If You Want to Try Containers)**

```bash
# Build the image (first time took me a while to get this right!)
docker build -t sentiment-analysis-app .

# Run it
docker run -p 5000:5000 sentiment-analysis-app

# Open http://localhost:5000
```

### **3️⃣ My Cloud Deployment Process**

*Note: This involves AWS setup and costs (though I use free tier)*

```bash
# You'll need AWS CLI and kubectl installed
# My deployment file (took many iterations to get right!)
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Check if it's working
kubectl get svc flask-app-service -n sentiment-analysis
```
